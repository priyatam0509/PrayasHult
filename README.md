# About us
Team Prayas comprise of the second-year trio of Arpan Mukherjee, Yash Gupta and Ayush Pareek, working under the leadership of Priyatam Piyush, their multifarious senior. The name of our team translates to "making an attempt", in Indic languages, which is a testimony to our underlying spirit.

We are exalted to announce that we have started off with our first set of operations, which is focused on making a change in the way we perceive food.

We thank the @Hult Prize Foundation, which gave us the chance to come together and realize our common goal, which is to persevere, in order to have a "better planet for a more profound mankind".
